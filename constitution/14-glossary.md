Observational Study, Retrospective: a study that identifies the
population and determines the exposure/treatment from historical data
(i.e., data generated before the initiation of the study). The variables and
outcomes of interest are determined at the time the study is designed.

Patient Registry: an organized system that uses observational study
methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified
outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or
exposure and that serves one or more predetermined scientific, clinical,
or policy purpose. Registries are generally defined either by diagnosis of
a disease (disease registry) or usage of a drug, device, or other treatment
(exposure registry).

Patient Reported Outcome (PRO): a measurement based on a
report that comes directly from the patient (i.e., study subject) about
the status of the patient’s health condition without amendment or
interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else. A
PRO can be measured by self-report or by interview, provided that the
interviewer records only the patient’s response.


Real-World Data (RWD): data relating to patient health status and/
or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources.
Real-World Evidence (RWE): clinical evidence regarding the
usage and potential benefits or risks of a medical product derived from
analysis of RWD.

Sentinel Initiative: a long-term effort to create a national electronic
system for monitoring FDA-regulated medical products.
Sentinel System: a system being developed and implemented
in stages, to expand FDA’s existing postmarket safety surveillance
capabilities by enabling FDA to actively gather information about the
safety of regulated medical products once they reach the market
