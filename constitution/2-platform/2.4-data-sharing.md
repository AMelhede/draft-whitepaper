Challenge: To allow users to publish their findings and reduce error in predictive analysis by increasing user sample size through the grouping of data from relatively homogeneous groups of users.

Approach: Establish a research commons to anonymously pool data in stratified user groups and share discoveries. We will support the development of a platform where anyone can share, access, and analyze anonymous data and publish studies. We will also enable the grouping of data among relatively homogenous groups of users stratified by their environmental, microbiomic, demographic, genomic and/or disease profiles.

Impact: Clinicians and those suffering from chronic conditions will have access to the personalized effectiveness rates of treatments and the percent likelihood of root causes.
