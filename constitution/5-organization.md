# Organization

CureDAO is a laboratory consisting of many experiments.

It‚Äôs a global laboratory where the 7 billion human ‚Äúnatural experiments‚Äù revealing the effects of various factors on human health and happiness are conducted.

It‚Äôs an experiment to determine if a new model for clinical research using real-world data can more effectively reduce the global burden of chronic illness.

It‚Äôs an experiment to see if a new economic model called Collaborationism can reward the creation of open-source ‚Äúpublic goods‚Äù and overcome the failures of Capitalism and Communism.

It‚Äôs an experiment to determine if a direct democracy can produce better results than traditional hierarchical command and control organizations.

Given the unprecedented nature of such a project, each working group will be constantly experimenting with new ways to execute this mission. We recognize the importance of using real-world evidence in the mission of improving human health.  Execution within the working groups should take the same data-driven approach to execute their area of the overall mission.

Accordingly, the organization is composed of Laboratories.  Each Laboratory will consist of a Lab Manager who helps Lab Technicians 
establish their Wildly Important Goals (WIG).

The democratic will of the Citizen Scientists of CureDAO will be carried out by:
1. DAO Laboratories
2. External Service Providers

## Citizens

As an open and permissionless organization, anyone has the right to earn their Citizenship through the contribution of labor or resources.  In exchange, the Citizen Scientist will receive aDAO Governance Tokens granting full governance 
rights over the actions of DAO Civil Servants.

1. Governance Debate on Discourse
2. Token-Based Voting by staking their Governance Tokens on smart contracts

## Civil Servants

Civil Servants comprise Working Groups who carry out the will if the DAO. Citizens can apply to join Working Groups based on their experience or
expertise. Working Groups elect Working Group Organizers, who are responsible for
leading Working Groups. Working Groups may decide to create incentives for
their Citizens in a variety of forms, including paying them for services or
creating bounties.
