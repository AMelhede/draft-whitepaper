# ❓ How To Get Involved

CureDAO is a laboratory consisting of many experiments.

It’s an experiment to determine if a new model for clinical research using real-world data can more effectively reduce the global burden of chronic illness.

It’s an experiment to see if a new economic model called Collaborationism can reward the creation of open-source “public goods” and overcome the failures of Capitalism and Communism.

It’s an experiment to determine if a direct democracy can produce better results than traditional hierarchical command and control organizations.

CureDAO is open to anyone interested in preventing suffering and death from chronic diseases and degenerative diseases. Our success in this mission will be an exponential function of the participation of people like you. 🚀

Creating a new software ecosystem for health data not only requires developers but anyone with skills in:

* User interface and user experience design
* Project management
* Communications and marketing
* Web3 technologies
* Business development
* Life sciences
* Medicine
* Data science

Our main philosophy is: It's not what you CAN do but what do you WANT to do is what counts.
