**:handshake:   HOW TO GET INVOLVED  :handshake:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

We rely heavily on Github (also for non-coders for project management, don't worry it's not that difficult)

1. Get an account on <https://github.com>
2. Star our Github: <https://github.com/cure-dao/>
3. Get the free ZenHub extension (to view issues from Github in Kanban boards and Gantt charts -> very cool)
     <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd>
4. Choose your working group (or more than one, more info here:
     <https://github.com/cure-dao/draft-whitepaper/blob/main/constitution/5-organization.md>)
5. Create, comment in Issues and contribute with linked pull requests
     (also for finished documents, presentations, design files Github is very cool for version management)
6. Help prioritize tasks (More Info and howto:
     <https://github.com/cure-dao/draft-whitepaper/blob/main/how-to/task-management/vote-on-tasks-and-sort-by-priority.md>)
7. Issues and tasks are assigned, discussed, reported, moved in the specific calls (see Events) to maintain overview and communication
8. Your contributions are tracked already within your github activity and discord activity and manually tracking your time for now
     (designers don't worry, everything will be weighted accordingly, details coming)
