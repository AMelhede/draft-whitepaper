## General principles

* **Accessibility**: Content should always be written in a way that is both scientifically accurate and at the same 
  time understandable by the layperson. It is important to note that, according to analytics, **66% of users are mobile users,** so content should be optimized for mobile use.
* **Word economy**: Do your best not to use any unnecessary space -- always try to aim for clarity and succinctness. Avoid including unnecessarily long sentences, paragraphs, and digressions. Focus on the vital information, and then re-read it to see if you can word it in a way that saves space or makes it easier to digest.
* **Avoid Walls of Text**: Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. Due to the 
  nature of the modern attention span, the way the text is structured is vital. This mostly comes in the form of simple, concise sentences and properly spaced paragraphs. Nothing gets people to disengage faster than a wall of text in poetic or abstract language.
* **Paragraph Length**: A typical paragraph should be roughly four simple sentences in length. Use three if they are more complex sentences with long dependent clauses (parts of a sentence that cannot stand alone). It is acceptable sometimes to use shorter paragraphs if they express a self-contained thought.
* **Short Sentences**: Minimize the use of dependent clauses or chains of independent clauses in a single sentence. 
  Err on the side of sentence breaks, even if it may sound a little stuttery.

### Example

Instead of using

> "In various studies, X has been shown to cause Y effect in some users, and this effect has been linked to various psychiatric conditions, as well as other negative effects on bodily organs."

**use**

> "Various studies have shown that X causes Y effect in some users. This effect has been linked to various psychiatric conditions as well as other adverse effects on bodily organs."

## Writing style

* ***Avoid*** loanwords (words in a language that are taken from another language without translation e.g.  *zeitgeist* ).
* ***Avoid*** passive speech; be direct.
* ***Avoid*** slang, vernacular, and idioms.
* ***Avoid*** addressing the reader at any point. Use the third person tense.
* ***Avoid*** using parenthetical clauses. Use separate sentences instead.
* ***Prefer*** using as few words as possible to make a point.
* ***Prefer*** short alternatives to long words.
* ***Prefer*** simple English**: not all of our users are native speakers.**
* ***Prefer*** concise and approachable speech.

## Grammar

### Capital letters

* Capitalization of article titles and section headers should follow standard Title Case.

## Linking

Link terms wherever more context may be useful to the reader. Adding multiple links for the same term is ideal in long articles in which linked instances of the term are very far apart.

### Internal links

Add links to other wiki pages wherever possible and avoid duplicating content.

## Flags

Flags (or tags) can be appended to text to signify a need for verification, revision, or other purposes. The most common kind is the missing citation flag or "cite flag" that appears in the form of [citation_needed].

The various kinds of flags available for use are listed below:


| **Flag type**     | **Purpose**                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| [citation_needed] | Statement is missing citation    |
| [clarify]         | Statement needs clarification    |
| [imperative]      | Statement uses imperative speech |
