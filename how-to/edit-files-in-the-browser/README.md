# ðŸ’» How to Contribute to the Docs

Every page is a [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file, which is an easy-to-learn syntax extension to plain text that makes creating links, rendering images, and nice-looking formatting simple.

## Fork the Repository

1. [Go to cure-dao/draft-whitepaper](https://github.com/cure-dao/draft-whitepaper)

## Editing Directly on GitHub

**(recommended for beginners or small changes)**

The fastest way is to edit directly on GitHub.&#x20;

Each page has an "Edit on Github" link to the right of the content. By clicking it you are taken to the GitHub sign-in page, where you can either log in or create an account.

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the GitHub built-in text editor where you can make your edits directly. When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed create a new Pull Request to the repository. From there one of the maintainers will review your changes, and either merge them or request changes.

Remember that after you click "Propose Changes", you must also click on "Create Pull Request" on the next page.

The process is illustrated in this [visual walk-through](https://scribehow.com/shared/How\_to\_Write\_a\_Constitution\_In\_a\_Democratic\_Fashion\_\_XPpT\_GzCQC27ouEjEF2oXg).

1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing `MarkDown` style, language, and layout.
2. Please adhere to the guidelines in the [Writing Style Guide](style-guide.md).
3. **Commit messages should be as detailed as possible to describe the changes made.**

## Editing Locally

**(recommended if you're going to do a lot of editing)**

If you're comfortable forking, cloning, editing files locally, and making pull requests, you can skip this section.

However, if that seems like a burden there are a few ways to edit right in your browser.
