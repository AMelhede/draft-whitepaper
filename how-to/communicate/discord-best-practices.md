- If you post links: What's your take/summary/learning from this? What's the ToDo here?
- Stay in the relevant channel with your topics.
- Avoid "non informative answers" like agreeing and use thumbs up emojis instead
- Ask the channel creator to update the first pinned message with summarized relevant information about the channel
- Debate less how and do more, often "done" is better than "perfect"
- Tell others what you are working on to avoid duplication and to increase efficiency of project management
