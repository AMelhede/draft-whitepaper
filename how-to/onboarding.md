**:rocket:  OUR MISSION  :rocket:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

Clinical Research and personal health management today have a data problem. not just a funding problem.
To find new cures faster and minimize the suffering from disease we aim to develop an open source health data software infrastructure for health data businesses to focus more on their core work instead of duplicating software development.
Think of it as what Wordpress is for Web-Designers or what Firebase is for Application developers.

**:point_right:  WE NEED YOU  :point_left:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

Do you believe in the acceleration of finding new cures through the power of data and web3?

This is why we need contributors from many backgrounds: 

:point_right:  Software developers/engineers\
:point_right:  Web3 / DAO / crypto experts\
:point_right:  Experience with health data, digital health or decentralized clinical trials\
:point_right:  Data scientists\
:point_right:  Communicators (article writers, social media artists)\
:point_right:  Designers (Product UX UI design, Infographics, CI)\
:point_right:  Community managers\
:point_right:  Business developers\
:point_right:  Meme artists (the real reason why we are doing this)\

**:handshake:   HOW TO GET INVOLVED  :handshake:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

We rely heavily on Github (also for non-coders for project management, don't worry it's not that difficult)

1.  Get an account on https://github.com
2. Star our Github: https://github.com/cure-dao/
3. Get the free ZenHub extension (to view issues from Github in Kanban boards and Gantt charts -> very cool) 
     https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd
4. Choose your working group (or more than one, more info here: 
     https://github.com/cure-dao/draft-whitepaper/blob/main/constitution/5-organization.md)
5. Create, comment in Issues and contribute with linked pull requests
     (also for finished documents, presentations, design files Github is very cool for version management)
6. Help prioritize tasks (More Info and howto: 
     https://github.com/cure-dao/draft-whitepaper/blob/main/how-to/task-management/vote-on-tasks-and-sort-by-priority.md)
7. Issues and tasks are assigned, discussed, reported, moved in the specific calls (see Events) to maintain overview and communication 
8. Your contributions are tracked already within your github activity and discord activity and manually tracking your time for now
     (designers don't worry, everything will be weighted accordingly, details coming)

**:thumbsup:  BEST PRACTICES  :thumbsup:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

- If you post links: What's your take/summary/learning from this? What's the ToDo here?
- Stay in the relevant channel with your topics. 
- Avoid "non informative answers" like agreeing and use thumbs up emojis instead
- Ask the channel creator to update the first pinned message with summarized relevant information about the channel
- Debate less how and do more, often "done" is better than "perfect"
- Tell others what you are working on to avoid duplication and to increase efficiency of project management

\
**:rotating_light:  CAUTION  :rotating_light:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

As seen in other DAO's: 
- Be careful about scams - our team will never ask you for passwords or private keys. DM an admin or a moderator if anything ever seems sketchy!
- We do **NOT have a token yet** and any coin with our name is unaffiliated with our project or community.

\
**:question:  FAQ  :question:**\
⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯

**Why don't you have code on github yet?**

We just started in 2022! We started to focus on the DAO infrastructure first, but once we start with the tech, we have a lot to bring already. But as this should be a community directed project we would also like to have other opinions and votes on structure and requirements on the architecture! Feel free to bring your critics and ideas!
