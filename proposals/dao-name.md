# DAO Name, Tagline, and Logo Proposals

The likelihood of success of the DAO will be a function of the number of its members.  In order to maximize this number, it is important that everyone sees themselves as an owner.

Once the initial core working group members have been established, a name, tagline, logo, and token name can be selected.

Until that time, the DAO shall be referred to with the placeholder Anonymous DAO.

The name, tagline, token name, and logo for the DAO will be determined using the following method:

1. Google Ads Conversion Rate - The click rate and conversion rate for all combinations of names and taglines and logos will be determined using Google Ads. (The click rate is the percentage of people that click on the ad. The conversion rate is the percentage of people that both click on the ad and take an action, like sign up for our newsletter.)
2. Rank Choice Voting - The list of options will be provided to DAO members with the Google Ads conversion rates. DAO members will then rank the options in order of preference.
