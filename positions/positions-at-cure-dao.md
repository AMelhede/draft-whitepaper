# Positions at CureDAO

One billion people are suffering from chronic conditions without knowing the root causes and most effective solutions.

* depression
* bipolar disorder
* fibromyalgia
* many others

Clinical research and diagnosis are too

1. expensive
2. slow
3. imprecise

CureDAO is going to change this.

Recent technological advances have produced a torrent of data on all aspects of human existence, including diet, physical activity, sleep, social interaction, environmental factors, symptom severity, vital signs, and others.  CureDAO aggregates and analyzes this data to obtain personalized effectiveness values for treatments and reveal root causes of chronic conditions.

Together, we have an enormous opportunity to dramatically accelerate the pace of clinical research and reduce suffering worldwide.
