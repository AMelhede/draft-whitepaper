# tl;dr

Anonymous DAO is a decentralized alliance of individuals, government, businesses, and nonprofits devoted to the
minimization of suffering.

To achieve this, we propose the creation of an open-source decentralized health platform
that will produce a massive acceleration of large scale research to discover new ways to prevent and treat chronic diseases.

It will overcome the traditional barriers to collaboration and data sharing by encoding all data and
intellectual property contributions to the platform in a non-fungible token (NFT). Using smart contracts, the platform will be able to compensate all contributors with royalties for their contributions.

# Why Should I Join?

[150,000](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-many-people-die-each-day-covid-19-coronavirus/) people die every day. This is equivalent to a September 11th terrorist attack occurring every [28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks#:~:text=During%20the%20September%2011%202001,and%2044%20were%20in%20Pennsylvania.) minutes. Additionally, there are over [2 billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people suffering from chronic diseases.

Since 2014, Healthcare spending has been [increasing faster than ever](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA).
([chart](./assets/healthcare-expenditure-per-capita.png))

Fortunately, there has been an explosion of recent technological advances in digital health including:

* genetic sequencing
* gut microbiome sequencing
* [350,000](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/health-care-blog/2021/how-digital-health-apps-are-empowering-patients.html#:~:text=Globally%2C%20more%20than%20350%2C000%20health,from%20the%20various%20app%20stores.) digital health apps
* a [billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/) connected wearable devices

These innovations have produced [50-fold](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/who-should-own-our-health-data/)
growth in the amount of data on every disease and every factor that could improve, exacerbate, or prevent it.
([chart](./assets/growth-in-health-data-chart.png))

This data exists in the form of:

- Electronic Medical Records
- Nutritional Supplement Purchases
- Data from diet and treatment tracking apps
- Genetic Sequencing
- Health insurance claims
- Grocery, pharmacy, and nutritional supplement receipts
- Clinical trial results

Despite all of this, life expectancy has actually been [declining](./assets/life-expectancy-chart.png) since 2014.

# Why haven't we seen a reduction in disease burden?

So, this explosion in technology, data, and spending has produced no measurable improvement
in human health.  The reason, in a single word, is **incentives**. The current economic system punishes every stakeholder in the ecosystem for doing the things that would lead to progress.

## $157 Billion Wasted on Duplication of Effort

There are more than [350,000](https://www.emarketer.com/content/over-350k-digital-health-apps-flooding-market-here-s-how-apps-stand) health apps. Mobile health app development costs [$425,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) on average.  Most of these
have a ton of overlap in functionality representing [$157,500,000,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) wasted on duplication of effort.

If this code was freely shared, everyone could build on what everyone else had done could increase the rate of
progress by 350,000 times.

![closed source competition vs open source collaboration](./assets/closed-source-competition-vs-open-source-collaboration.sketch.png)

The obstacle has been the free-rider problem. Software Developers that open source their code give their
closed-source competitors an unfair advantage.  This increases their likelihood of bankruptcy even higher than the 90% failure rate they already faced.

### How to Overcome the Free-Rider Problem

1. Currently governments around the world are spending billions funding closed-source propriety health software. The
   Public Money Public Code initiative would require governments to recognize software as a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) and require that publicly-funded software be open source.
2. By encoding contributions to the project with NFTs, we can guarantee ongoing compensation in the
   form of royalties.

## Isolated Data Silos

The best that isolated data on individual aspects of human health can do is tell us about the past. For example,
dashboards telling us how many steps we got or how much sleep we got are known as ‚Äúdescriptive statistics‚Äù.  However,
by integrating all available data from individuals, similar populations, as well as existing clinical research
findings and applying machine learning we may achieve ‚Äúprescriptive‚Äù real-time decision support.

To facilitate data sharing, the DAO will provide data providers with an onsite easily provisionable OAuth2 API server that will allow individuals to anonymously share their data with the global biobank.

![APIs make siloed data useful](./assets/apis-siloed-data.svg)

## Lack of Incentive to Research Unpatentable Molecules

We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over [7,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8757191/Are-additives-food-making-ill.html) different synthetic or natural chemicals you consume every day.

Under the current system of research, it costs [$41k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001#:~:text=The%20clinical%20trials%20cost%20a,and%20benchmarking%20clinical%20trial%20costs.) per subject in Phase III clinical trials. As a result, there is not a sufficient profit incentive for anyone to research the effects of any factor besides a molecule that can be patented.

Lack of Incentive to Discover the Full Range of Applications for Off-Patent Treatments

There are roughly [10,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/17/are-there-really-10000-diseases-and-500-cures/) known diseases afflicting humans, most of which (approximately 95%) are classified as ‚Äúorphan‚Äù (rare) diseases. The current system requires that a pharmaceutical company predict a particular condition in advance of running clinical trials. If a drug is found to be effective for other diseases after the patent has expired, no one has the financial incentive to get it approved for another disease.

# Benefits of an Open-Source Platform for Research

Observational real-world evidence-based studies have several advantages over randomized, controlled trials, including
lower cost, greater timeliness, and a broader range of patients. Concern about inherent bias in these studies,
however, has limited their use in comparing treatments. Observational studies have been primarily used in
situations in which randomized, controlled trials would be impossible or unethical. However,
meta-analyses found that when applying modern
statistical methodologies to observational studies, the results are generally [not quantitatively or qualitatively
different](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200006223422506) from those obtained in randomized, controlled trials.

Thus, we can treat the human as a black box and apply predictive
machine learning models to all of the existing real-world data to stratified groups of similar people based on their:

- [Genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics)
- [Metabolomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics)
- [Microbiomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota)
- [Diseasomic](http://ijream.org/papers/IJREAMV05I0250057.pdf)
- [Pharmacomicrobiomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacomicrobiomics)
- [Pharmacogenomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics)
- [Foodomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodomics)

profiles. This will enable us to discover the personalized full range of positive and negative for all factors
without a profit incentive for traditional trials.

We have currently 

## The Potential of Real-World Evidence-Based Studies

- **Population health** - Monitor big data to identify disease trends and health strategies based on demographics,
  geography, and socioeconomic

# Platform

The platform will consist of two primary components:

1. **Core Framework** - This will be open-source and include only universally necessary features.  This
   primarily consists of user authentication, data owner access controls, data storage, data validation, and an API
   for storage and retrieval.
   The DAO will compensate contributors to the core platform.
2. **Plugins** - These will be modules that provide additional functionality data import from specific sources, data mapping to various formats, data analysis, data visualization, notifications. These may be free or monetized by their creator.

![platform diagram](./assets/platform-architecture.drawio.png)

## Technical Framework

### 1. Data Ingestion API (core component)

Challenge: To acquire, extract, transform, and normalize the countless unstandardized data export file formats and data structures and load them into a standardized structure that can be easily analyzed to derive clinical insight.

Approach: We will develop an application programming interface (API) and OpenAPI specification for receiving and sharing data with the core database.  Software development kits (SDK‚Äôs) will be made available for 3rd party applications to use to interact with the API. Plugins will enable spreadsheet upload/import and scheduled imports from existing third-party
APIs.

Impact: The API connector framework will allow the ongoing regular import of user data after a single user authorization.  SDK‚Äôs will enable developers to implement easy automatic sharing options in their applications. An increase in the quantity of data will produce a proportional increase in the number of clinical discoveries made.

### 2. Raw Data Storage (core component)

Data will be encrypted stored in its raw format in flat files on a secure cloud provider defined in the
framework instance platform settings.  Preservation of the data in its original format will allow for:

1. Asynchronous Queued Data Parsing Jobs - This is necessary to allow for the data to be parsed in parallel
   offline and avoid overloading the webserver.
2. Storage of data incompatible with a time-series relational data store.
3. Storage of data formats that do not yet have defined parser plugins.  This will allow for the data to be imported
   at a later date when the data mapper has been defined.
4. Updating parsers to support changes in the response format for a particular API.

### 3. Data Mappers (core components and plugins)

These will be executed in an asynchronous queue to map the raw data to a standardized format and provide it to the
validator.  The most common data mappers will be defined in the framework.

These include

Less common data mappers will be
available as plugins from 3rd party developers.

### 4. Data Validation (core component)

The data validation middleware will validate the data before it is stored in the relational database.  It
will be responsible for ensuring that the data is in a consistent format and that it is not malformed. It
will also ensure that values are within the expected range for a given variable or unit.

#### 5. Relational Time Series Data Storage (core component)

After validation and mapping, time-series data will be stored in a relational database.  The use of a
relational data store with defined foreign key relationships will ensure atomicity and data veracity.

### 6. Data Owner Dashboard (core component)

A data owner dashboard will allow them to manage their data and access control settings. It will allow them to:

- view their data and the OAuth clients with access to it
- modify read/write permissions for specific OAuth clients
- restrict access to their data to specific users and groups
- delete data
- view their current compensation balance and make withdrawals
- update their profile information
- configure 2-factor authentication

## Plugin Types

Plugins will be stored in their own repositories based on a plugin template repository.  The plugin template
repository will contain defined interfaces required for interoperability with the core framework.

### 1. Data Analysis Plugins

Challenge: To quantify the effectiveness of treatments for specific individuals, reveal hidden factors exacerbating their illness, and determine personalized optimal daily values for these factors.

Approach: We will develop time-series machine learning algorithms to

- quantify the effect size of all factors on symptom severity
- determine the optimal daily dosage of
  nutrients, sleep, exercise, medications, and other factors necessary to minimize symptom severity.

Impact: This will mitigate the incidence of chronic illnesses by informing the user of symptom triggers, such as dietary sensitivities, to be avoided. This will also assist patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive experiment.

### 2. Data Visualization

Data visualization plugin modules will be utilized to visualize the data from a given subject or group in a meaningful
way.  Visualizations may be displayed in studies or on the data owner dashboard.

### 3. API Connectors

API Connector plugins will be called by the webserver to:

1. handle the OAuth2 authorization flow and store their credentials in the relational database
2. provide the original raw response to the framework for encryption and storage

A job scheduler will call the API connectors periodically (usually daily) to:

1. Refresh the user's OAuth access token
2. Fetch new data or data that has been modified since the last import
3. Map the response to the standard format as defined by the OpenAPI specification for the framework API
4. Provide the processed data to the framework's validation middleware.
5. All valid data will be stored in the relational database. Otherwise, the data will be rejected and the plugin developer and data owner will be notified.

### 4. Spreadsheet and PDF Importers

Upon upload, the webserver will call the File Importer plugin:

1. Provide the original file to the framework for encryption and storage
2. Add the file to a queue for processing by the job scheduler
   The background job scheduler will:
3. Retrieve the file from the encrypted storage
4. Extract the data from the file
5. Mapped to the standard format as defined by the framework OpenAPI specification
6. The processed data will be provided to the framework's validation middleware.
7. Valid data will be stored in the relational database.
8. Invalid data from the plugin will be rejected and the plugin developer and data owner will be notified.

# Incentive Alignment

Fully realizing the potential of the personalized preventative medicine of the future will require incentivizing
cooperation between the following stakeholders.

## 1. Patients

Incentives for Patients to share their de-identified data will include:

1. Actionable ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.
2. The ability to license and earn a share of income for use of their data for research and development by
   pharmaceutical companies and other businesses.  This will be achieved by encoding the user data using
   non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and issuing them to the user.  The NFTs will be linked to the user's cryptographic
   wallet address.  Using a smart contract, the user will receive an ongoing royalty share of the profits for any
   product that was developed using their data for research and development.

## 2. Business Housing Data Silos

Business Housing Data Silos would include health insurers, pharmacies, grocery delivery services, digital health
apps, hospitals, etc. These will be incentivized to allow individuals to easily share their data via a well-documented
OAuth2 API by:

1. A share of income for use of their data for research and development.
2. An on-site instance of the OAuth2 server to retrieve required data from their
   on-premise databases.
3. An eventual reduction in their employee healthcare costs (one of their largest expenses) by resulting from the
   discovery of new ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.

### 4. Digital Health Businesses

On top of the incentives for businesses listed above, the following incentives will be provided to digital health
businesses which enable data sharing:

1. A license to use a white-labelled version of the framework.  This will dramatically reduce the costs of software
   development. These reduced costs will allow them to focus on innovating their unique value proposition, making
   them more competitive in the market.

## 5. Disease Advocacy Non-Profit Organizations

Disease advocacy non-profits will be incentivized to promote observational studies
through the anonymous donation data by their members by:

1. Accelerated furtherance of their mission to reduce the incidence of chronic illnesses.
2. A new method of member engagement more motivating and productive than the traditional charity walk.

## 6. Government Health Agencies

Governments will be incentivized by:

1. A reduction in healthcare costs
2. Furtherance of their stated reason for existence to protect and promote
3. Public pressure on elective representatives
   the general welfare to introduce legislation
4. protect the rights of individual's data by requiring businesses in possession of silos
   of user data allow individuals to access and share their data via a well-documented OAuth2 API
5. Require that all publicly funded digital-health software projects be free, secure, and open-source. Currently, the
   majority of government contracts go to closed-source and proprietary software.  This leads to massive waste as
   governments around the world are paying to reinvent the wheel instead of sharing the costs. Shockingly, there is
   even a great deal of wasted money on duplicated software contracts between different agencies within the same
   government
6. Require international cooperation for all public health efforts to reduce wasted duplication of effort and take
   advantage of natural experiments resulting from differing public health regulations between nations.
7. Allow citizens to anonymously share their data in a global database.  This will enable us to take advantage of
   natural experiments resulting from differing public
   health regulations between nations.  For instance, 27 countries have banned the use of the pesticide glyphosate
   due to concerns about the health effects.  If no overall change in the health of the populations is observed, it
   will suggest that the health concerns may be unfounded.

## 6. Contributors to the Development of the Platform

Members of the DAO will be incentivized to contribute to the development of the platform by:
