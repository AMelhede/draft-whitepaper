# tl;dr

Anonymous DAO is a decentralized alliance of individuals, government, businesses, and nonprofits devoted to the
minimization of suffering.

To achieve this, we propose the creation of an open-source decentralized health platform
that will produce a massive acceleration of large-scale research to discover new ways to prevent and treat chronic diseases.

It will overcome the traditional barriers to collaboration and data sharing by encoding all data and
intellectual property contributions to the platform in a non-fungible token (NFT). Using smart contracts, the platform will be able to compensate all contributors with royalties for their contributions.
