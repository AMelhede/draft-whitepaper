# tl;dr

Anonymous DAO is a decentralized alliance of individuals, government, businesses, and nonprofits devoted to the
minimization of suffering.

To achieve this, we propose the creation of an open-source decentralized health platform
that will produce a massive acceleration of large scale research to discover new ways to prevent and treat chronic diseases.

It will overcome the traditional barriers to collaboration and data sharing by encoding all data and
intellectual property contributions to the platform in a non-fungible token (NFT). Using smart contracts, the platform will be able to compensate all contributors with royalties for their contributions.

# 1.    The Problem: You and Everyone You Love Will Suffer and Die

There are over [2 billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people suffering from chronic
diseases.

Additionally, [150,000](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-many-people-die-each-day-covid-19-coronavirus/)
people die every single day. For perspective, this is equivalent to:

- **[FIFTY-ONE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks)** September 11th
  attacks
  every day
- **[NINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks)** Holocausts every year

## 1.1  Failed Solutions

### 1.1.1   Will throwing more money at the existing healthcare system save us?

Since 2014, healthcare spending per person has been [increasing faster than ever](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA) faster than ever before.

![health spending](./assets/us-healthcare-expenditure-per-person.png)

Despite this additional spending, life expectancy has actually been [declining](./assets/life-expectancy-chart.png)
since 2014.

### 1.1.2   Will digital health innovation save us?

There has been an explosion of recent technological advances in digital health including:

* genetic sequencing
* gut microbiome sequencing
* [350,000](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/health-care-blog/2021/how-digital-health-apps-are-empowering-patients.html) digital health apps
* a [billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/) connected wearable devices

These innovations have produced [50-fold](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/who-should-own-our-health-data/) growth in the amount of data on every disease and every factor that could improve, exacerbate, or prevent it.
([chart](./assets/growth-in-health-data-chart.png))

This data exists in the form of:

- Electronic Medical Records
- Nutritional Supplement Purchases
- Data from diet and treatment tracking apps
- Genetic Sequencing
- Health insurance claims
- Grocery, pharmacy, and nutritional supplement receipts
- Clinical trial results

The digital health revolution started over a decade ago. It was promised to improve human health and reduce costs. Yet,
all we've seen is increasing costs, increasing disease burden, and decreasing life expectancy.

![cost and death](./assets/health-care-costs-and-life-expectancy.png)

## 1.2  Why haven't we seen a reduction in disease burden?

So, this explosion in technology, data, and spending has produced no measurable improvement in human health.  The reason, in a single word, is **incentives**. The current economic system punishes every stakeholder in the ecosystem for doing the things that would lead to progress.

## Conflicts of Interest

Long-term randomized trials are extremely expensive to set up and run, and it can be difficult to find study funders. Unfortunately, typically the only one's that can afford to run these studies are industry groups. When a group's economic survival is at risk, bias will almost inevitably influence the results. For example, an analysis of beverage studies, [published in the journal PLOS Medicine,](https://web.archive.org/web/20211207021133/https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001578#s3) found that those funded by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association and the sugar industry were **five times** more likely to find no link between sugary drinks and weight gain than studies whose authors reported no financial conflicts.


### 1.2.1   $157 Billion Wasted on Duplication of Effort

There are more than [350,000](https://www.emarketer.com/content/over-350k-digital-health-apps-flooding-market-here-s-how-apps-stand) health apps. Mobile health app development costs [$425,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) on average.  Most of these
have a ton of overlap in functionality representing [$157,500,000,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) wasted on duplication of effort.

If this code was freely shared, everyone could build on what everyone else had done could increase the rate of
progress by 350,000 times.

![closed source competition vs open source collaboration](./assets/closed-source-competition-vs-open-source-collaboration.sketch.png)

The obstacle has been the free-rider problem. Software Developers that open source their code give their
closed-source competitors an unfair advantage.  This increases their likelihood of bankruptcy even higher than the 90% failure rate they already faced.

#### How to Overcome the Free-Rider Problem

1. Currently governments around the world are spending billions funding closed-source propriety health software. The
   Public Money Public Code initiative would require governments to recognize software as a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) and require that publicly-funded software be open source.
2. By encoding contributions to the project with NFTs, we can guarantee ongoing compensation in the
   form of royalties.

### Isolated Data Silos

The best that isolated data on individual aspects of human health can do is tell us about the past. For example,
dashboards telling us how many steps we got or how much sleep we got are known as ‚Äúdescriptive statistics‚Äù.  However,
by integrating all available data from individuals, similar populations, as well as existing clinical research
findings and applying machine learning we may achieve ‚Äúprescriptive‚Äù real-time decision support.

To facilitate data sharing, the DAO will provide data providers with an onsite easily provisionable OAuth2 API server that will allow individuals to anonymously share their data with the global biobank.

![APIs make siloed data useful](./assets/apis-siloed-data.svg)

### Lack of Incentive to Research Unpatentable Molecules

We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over [7,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8757191/Are-additives-food-making-ill.html) different synthetic or natural chemicals you consume every day.

Under the current system of research, it costs [$41k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001#:~:text=The%20clinical%20trials%20cost%20a,and%20benchmarking%20clinical%20trial%20costs.) per subject in Phase III clinical trials. As a result, there is not a sufficient profit incentive for anyone to research the effects of any factor besides a molecule that can be patented.

![how much we know](./assets/how-much-we-know.png)

### Lack of Incentive to Discover the Full Range of Applications for Off-Patent Treatments

There are roughly [10,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/17/are-there-really-10000-diseases-and-500-cures/) known diseases afflicting humans, most of which (approximately 95%) are classified as ‚Äúorphan‚Äù (rare) diseases. The current system requires that a pharmaceutical company predict a particular condition in advance of running clinical trials. If a drug is found to be effective for other diseases after the patent has expired, no one has the financial incentive to get it approved for another disease.

# 2. Solution

## Use The Oceans of Real-World Evidence to Discover New Cures

## The Potential of Real-World Evidence-Based Studies

- **Diagnostics** - Data mining and analysis to identify causes of illness
- **Preventative medicine** - Predictive analytics and data analysis of genetic, lifestyle, and social circumstances
  to prevent disease
- **Precision medicine** - Leveraging aggregate data to drive hyper-personalized care
- **Medical research** - Data-driven medical and pharmacological research to cure disease and discover new
  treatments and medicines
- **Reduction of adverse medication events** - Harnessing of big data to spot medication errors and flag potential
  adverse reactions
- **Cost reduction** - Identification of value that drives better patient outcomes for long-term savings
- **Population health** - Monitor big data to identify disease trends and health strategies based on demographics,
  geography, and socioeconomic

### Correlational is Not The Same as Causation

![Correlation vs Causation](./assets/correlation-does-not-equal-causation-comic.png)

When people think of observational research, they typically think of correlational association studies.

#### Why It Seems Like Diet Advice Flip-Flops All the Time

In 1977, the USDA warned Americans against the perils of dietary cholesterol. And yet in 1999, TIME released a very
different cover,
suggesting that dietary cholesterol and eggs are in fact okay.

![eggs time covers](assets/eggs-time-covers.png)

[Hill‚Äôs criteria for causation](http://www.drabruzzi.com/hills_criteria_of_causation.htm) specify the minimal conditions necessary to accept the likelihood of a causal relationship between two measures as:

* ***Strength***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if the correlation coefficient is large and statistically significant.
* ***Consistency***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if it can be replicated.
* ***Specificity***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if there is no other likely explanation.
* ***Temporality***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if the effect always occurs after the cause.
* ***Gradient***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if a greater exposure to the suspected cause leads to a greater effect.
* ***Plausibility***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if there is a plausible mechanism between the cause and the effect
* ***Coherence***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if it is compatible with related facts and theories.
* ***Experiment***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if it can be verified experimentally.
* ***Analogy***: A relationship is more likely to be causal if there are proven relationships between similar causes and effects.

### Meta-Analyses Support of Real-World Evidence

Observational real-world evidence-based studies have several advantages over randomized, controlled trials, including
lower cost, greater timeliness, and a broader range of patients. Concern about inherent bias in these studies,
however, has limited their use in comparing treatments. Observational studies have been primarily used in
situations in which randomized, controlled trials would be impossible or unethical.

However, [meta-analyses](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200006223422506) found that:

> when applying modern statistical methodologies to observational studies, the results are generally **not quantitatively or qualitatively different** from those obtained in randomized, controlled trials.

![Mortality Observational Studies](https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2000/nejm_2000.342.issue-25/nejm200006223422506/production/images/img_medium/nejm200006223422506_f1.jpeg)

![Observational Studies for Various Outcomes](https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2000/nejm_2000.342.issue-25/nejm200006223422506/production/images/img_medium/nejm200006223422506_f2.jpeg)

## Evidence in Support of Real-World Evidence

Let's start at the beginning.  The beginning of human history.

There is compelling historical evidence suggesting that large scale efficacy-trials based on real-world evidence
have ultimately led to better health outcomes than current pharmaceutical industry-driven randomized controlled trials.

![](./assets/real-world-evidence-in-efficacy-clinical-trials-vs-rcts.png)

### An Experiment on Experiments

Validation of the theory that large-scale real-world evidence can produce better health outcomes, will require us to run an experiment to validate this method of experimentation.

## A Black Box Approach to Personalized Medicine

Thus, we can treat the human as a black box and apply predictive
machine learning models to all of the existing real-world data to stratified groups of similar people based on their:

- [Genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics)
- [Metabolomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics)
- [Microbiomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota)
- [Diseasomic](http://ijream.org/papers/IJREAMV05I0250057.pdf)
- [Pharmacomicrobiomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacomicrobiomics)
- [Pharmacogenomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics)
- [Foodomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodomics)

profiles. This will enable us to discover the personalized full range of positive and negative for all factors
without a profit incentive for traditional trials.

## Our Current Research

We publish our anonymously aggregated analyses at the [Journal of Citizen Science](https://app.crowdsourcingcures.org/). So far, we‚Äôve collected over 10
million data points on symptom severity and influencing factors from over 10,000 participants. This data has been
used to publish 90,000 studies on the effects of various treatments and food ingredients on condition severity.

![journal of citizen science](./assets/journal-of-citizen-science.png)

# Platform

The platform will consist of two primary components:

1. **Core Framework** - This will be open-source and include only universally necessary features.  This
   primarily consists of user authentication, data owner access controls, data storage, data validation, and an API
   for storage and retrieval.
   The DAO will compensate contributors to the core platform.
2. **Plugins** - These will be modules that provide additional functionality data import from specific sources, data mapping to various formats, data analysis, data visualization, notifications. These may be free or monetized by their creator.

![platform diagram](./assets/platform-architecture.drawio.png)

## Technical Framework

### 1. Data Ingestion API (core component)

Challenge: To acquire, extract, transform, and normalize the countless unstandardized data export file formats and data structures and load them into a standardized structure that can be easily analyzed to derive clinical insight.

Approach: We will develop an application programming interface (API) and OpenAPI specification for receiving and sharing data with the core database.  Software development kits (SDK‚Äôs) will be made available for 3rd party applications to use to interact with the API. Plugins will enable spreadsheet upload/import and scheduled imports from existing third-party
APIs.

Impact: The API connector framework will allow the ongoing regular import of user data after a single user authorization.  SDK‚Äôs will enable developers to implement easy automatic sharing options in their applications. An increase in the quantity of data will produce a proportional increase in the number of clinical discoveries made.

### 2. Raw Data Storage (core component)

Data will be encrypted stored in its raw format in flat files on a secure cloud provider defined in the
framework instance platform settings.  Preservation of the data in its original format will allow for:

1. Asynchronous Queued Data Parsing Jobs - This is necessary to allow for the data to be parsed in parallel
   offline and avoid overloading the webserver.
2. Storage of data incompatible with a time-series relational data store.
3. Storage of data formats that do not yet have defined parser plugins.  This will allow for the data to be imported
   at a later date when the data mapper has been defined.
4. Updating parsers to support changes in the response format for a particular API.

### 3. Data Mappers (core components and plugins)

These will be executed in an asynchronous queue to map the raw data to a standardized format and provide it to the validator.  The most common data mappers will be defined in the framework. Less common data mappers will be available as plugins from 3rd party developers.

TODO: Determine core data mappers

### 4. Data Validation (core component)

The data validation middleware will validate the data before it is stored in the relational database.  It
will be responsible for ensuring that the data is in a consistent format and that it is not malformed. It
will also ensure that values are within the expected range for a given variable or unit.

#### 5. Relational Time Series Data Storage (core component)

After validation and mapping, time-series data will be stored in a relational database.  The use of a
relational data store with defined foreign key relationships will ensure atomicity and data veracity.

### 6. Data Owner Dashboard (core component)

A data owner dashboard will allow them to manage their data and access control settings. It will allow them to:

- view their data and the OAuth clients with access to it
- modify read/write permissions for specific OAuth clients
- restrict access to their data to specific users and groups
- delete data
- view their current compensation balance and make withdrawals
- update their profile information
- configure 2-factor authentication

## Plugin Types

Plugins will be stored in their own repositories based on a plugin template repository.  The plugin template
repository will contain defined interfaces required for interoperability with the core framework.

### 1. Data Analysis Plugins

Challenge: To quantify the effectiveness of treatments for specific individuals, reveal hidden factors exacerbating their illness, and determine personalized optimal daily values for these factors.

Approach: We will develop time-series machine learning algorithms to

- quantify the effect size of all factors on symptom severity
- determine the optimal daily dosage of
  nutrients, sleep, exercise, medications, and other factors necessary to minimize symptom severity.

Impact: This will mitigate the incidence of chronic illnesses by informing the user of symptom triggers, such as dietary sensitivities, to be avoided. This will also assist patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive experiment.

### 2. Data Visualization

Data visualization plugin modules will be utilized to visualize the data from a given subject or group in a meaningful
way.  Visualizations may be displayed in studies or on the data owner dashboard.

#### Example Visualizations

Currently, all foods carry nutrition labels such as this one:

![](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nutrition-label-436x1024-1.jpg)

But how useful is it to the average person to know the amount of Riboflavin in something? The purpose of nutritional labels is to help individuals make choices that will improve their health and prevent disease.

Telling the average person the amount of riboflavin in something isn‚Äôt going to achieve this. This is evidenced by the fact that these labels have existed for decades and during this time, we‚Äôve only seen increases in most diseases they were intended to reduce.

We have created a new and improved **Outcomes Label** that instead lists the degree to which the product is likely
to improve or worsen specific health outcomes or symptoms. We currently have generated Outcome Labels for thousands
of foods, drugs, and nutritional supplements that can be found at [Journal of Citizen Science](https://studies.crowdsourcingcures.org/). These labels are derived from the analysis of 10 million data points anonymously donated by over 10,000 study participants via [our web app](https://app.crowdsourcingcures.org/?swcfpc=1#/app/intro).

![](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nutrition-facts-vs-outcome-labels-melatonin-1024x592.png)

### Data Quantity Required for Outcome Labels

The Foundation has collected over 10 million data points on symptom severity and influencing factors from over 10,000 people. The Foundation develops and applies predictive machine learning algorithms to the data to reveal effectiveness and side-effects of treatments and the degree to which hidden dietary and environmental improve or exacerbate chronic illnesses

These analytical results have been used to freely publish 90,000 studies on the effects of various treatments and food ingredients on symptom severity.

![](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/johnny-5-need-input.gif)

Although 10 million data points sound like a lot, currently, the usefulness and accuracy of these Outcome Labels are currently limited. This is due to the fact there are only a few study participants have donated data for a particular food paired with a particular symptom. In observational research such as this, a very large number of participants are required to cancel out all the errors and coincidences that can influence the data for a single individual.

For instance, someone with depression may have started taking an antidepressant at the same time they started seeing a therapist. Then, if their depression improves, it‚Äôs impossible to know if the improvement was a result of the antidepressant, the therapist, both, or something else. These random factors are known as confounding variables. However, random confounding factors can cancel each other out when looking at large data sets. This is why it‚Äôs important to collect as much data as possible.

### Data Sources for Outcome Labels

Several types of data are used to derive the Outcome Labels:

1. **Individual Micro-Level Data** ‚Äì This could include data manually entered or imported from other devices or apps
   in [our app](http://app.crowdsourcingcures.org/?swcfpc=1), This could also include shopping receipts for foods,
   drugs, or nutritional supplements purchased and insurance claim data.
2. **Macro-Level Epidemiological Data** ‚Äì This includes the incidence of various diseases over time combined with data on the amounts of different drugs or food additives. This is how it was initially discovered that smoking caused lung cancer. With macro-level data, it‚Äôs even harder to distinguish correlation from causation. However, different countries often enact different policies that can serve as very useful natural experiments. For instance, 30 countries have banned the use of glyphosate. If the rates of Alzheimer‚Äôs, autism, and depression declined in these countries and did not decline in the countries still using glyphosate, this would provide very powerful evidence regarding its effects. Unfortunately, there is no global database that currently provides easy access to the incidence of these conditions in various countries over time and the levels of exposure to various chemicals.
3. **Clinical Trial Data** ‚Äì This is the gold standard with regard to the level of confidence that a factor is truly the cause of an outcome. However, it‚Äôs also the most expensive to collect. As a result, clinical trials are often very small (less than 50 people). Exclusion criteria in trials often prevent study participants from being representative of real patients. There are ethical considerations that prevent us from running trials that have any risk of harm to participants. Due to the expense involved we have very few trials run on anything other than a molecule that can be patented and sold as a drug.

### 3. API Connectors

API Connector plugins will be called by the webserver to:

1. handle the OAuth2 authorization flow and store their credentials in the relational database
2. provide the original raw response to the framework for encryption and storage

A job scheduler will call the API connectors periodically (usually daily) to:

1. Refresh the user's OAuth access token
2. Fetch new data or data that has been modified since the last import
3. Map the response to the standard format as defined by the OpenAPI specification for the framework API
4. Provide the processed data to the framework's validation middleware.
5. All valid data will be stored in the relational database. Otherwise, the data will be rejected and the plugin developer and data owner will be notified.

### 4. Spreadsheet and PDF Importers

Upon upload, the webserver will call the File Importer plugin:

1. Provide the original file to the framework for encryption and storage
2. Add the file to a queue for processing by the job scheduler
   The background job scheduler will:
3. Retrieve the file from the encrypted storage
4. Extract the data from the file
5. Mapped to the standard format as defined by the framework OpenAPI specification
6. The processed data will be provided to the framework's validation middleware.
7. Valid data will be stored in the relational database.
8. Invalid data from the plugin will be rejected and the plugin developer and data owner will be notified.

# Incentive Alignment

Fully realizing the potential of the personalized preventative medicine of the future will require incentivizing cooperation between the following stakeholders:

![incentive alignment](assets/incentive-alignment.png)

## 1. Patients

Incentives for Patients to share their de-identified data will include:

1. Actionable ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.
2. The ability to license and earn a share of income for use of their data for research and development by
   pharmaceutical companies and other businesses.  This will be achieved by encoding the user data using
   non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and issuing them to the user.  The NFTs will be linked to the user's cryptographic wallet address.  Using a smart contract, the user will receive an ongoing royalty share of the profits for any product that was developed using their data for research and development.
3. TODO: Determine amount of reward for sharing.

## 2. Business Housing Data Silos

Business Housing Data Silos would include health insurers, pharmacies, grocery delivery services, digital health
apps, hospitals, etc. These will be incentivized to allow individuals to easily share their data via a well-documented
OAuth2 API by:

1. A share of income for use of their data for research and development.
2. An on-site instance of the OAuth2 server to retrieve required data from their
   on-premise databases.
3. An eventual reduction in their employee healthcare costs (one of their largest expenses) by resulting from the discovery of new ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.

## 4. Digital Health Businesses

On top of the incentives for businesses listed above, the following incentives will be provided to digital health businesses which enable data sharing:

1. A license to use a white-labelled version of the framework.  This will dramatically reduce the costs of software development. These reduced costs will allow them to focus on innovating their unique value proposition, making them more competitive in the market.

## 5. Disease Advocacy Non-Profit Organizations

Disease advocacy non-profits will be incentivized to promote observational studies
through the anonymous donation data by their members by:

1. Accelerated furtherance of their mission to reduce the incidence of chronic illnesses.
2. A new method of member engagement more motivating and productive than the traditional charity walk.

## 6. Government Health Agencies

Governments will be incentivized by:

1. A reduction in government healthcare costs due to the discovery of new ways to prevent and mitigate chronic illnesses.
2. Furtherance of their stated reason for existence to protect and promote the general welfare.
   The general welfare is defined as the overall health and happiness of the population.
3. Their duty to protect the rights of individual's data. To fulfill this, they must requiring businesses in
   possession of it to give them ability to access and share their data via a well-documented OAuth2 API
4. Cost-savings from using open-source software.  All publicly funded digital-health software projects be free, secure, and open-source. Currently, the majority of government contracts go to closed-source and proprietary software.  This leads to massive waste as governments around the world are paying to reinvent the wheel instead of sharing the costs. Shockingly, there is even a great deal of wasted money on duplicated software contracts between different agencies within the same governments.
5. Require international cooperation for all public health efforts to reduce wasted duplication of effort and take advantage of natural experiments resulting from differing public health regulations between nations.
6. Epidemiological discoveries from allowing citizens to anonymously share their data in a global database.  This will enable us to take advantage of natural experiments resulting from differing public health regulations between nations.  For instance, 27 countries have banned the use of the pesticide glyphosate due to concerns about the health effects.  If no overall change in the health of the populations is observed, it will suggest that the health concerns may be unfounded.

## 7. Contributors to the Development of the Platform

Members of the DAO will be incentivized to contribute to the development of the platform by:
TODO: Determine amount and type of reward for contributing to the development of the platform.
