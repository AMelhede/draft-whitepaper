# tl;dr

Anonymous DAO is a decentralized alliance of individuals and government, businesses, and nonprofits devoted to the minimization of suffering.

To achieve this, we propose the creation of an open-source decentralized health platform
that will produce a massive acceleration of large scale research to discover new ways to prevent and treat chronic diseases.

It will overcome the traditional barriers to collaboration and data sharing by encoding all data and
intellectual property contributions to the platform in a non-fungible token (NFT). Using smart contracts, the platform will be able to compensate all contributors with royalties for their contributions.

# Why Should I Join?

[150,000](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-many-people-die-each-day-covid-19-coronavirus/) people die every day. This is equivalent to a September 11th terrorist attack occurring every [28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks#:~:text=During%20the%20September%2011%202001,and%2044%20were%20in%20Pennsylvania.) minutes. Additionally, there are over [2 billion](https://www.george-health.com/global-health-challenge/) people suffering from chronic diseases.

Since 2014, Healthcare spending has been [increasing faster than ever](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA).
([chart](./assets/healthcare-expenditure-per-capita.png))

Fortunately, there has been an explosion of recent technological advances in digital health including:

* genetic sequencing
* gut microbiome sequencing
* [350,000](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/health-care-blog/2021/how-digital-health-apps-are-empowering-patients.html#:~:text=Globally%2C%20more%20than%20350%2C000%20health,from%20the%20various%20app%20stores.) digital health apps
* a [billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/) connected wearable devices

These innovations have produced [50-fold](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/who-should-own-our-health-data/)
growth in the amount of data on every disease and every factor that could improve, exacerbate, or prevent it.
([chart](./assets/growth-in-health-data-chart.png))

This data exists in the form of:

- Electronic Medical Records
- Nutritional Supplement Purchases
- Data from diet and treatment tracking apps
- Genetic Sequencing
- Health insurance claims
- Grocery, pharmacy, and nutritional supplement receipts
- Clinical trial results

Despite all of this, life expectancy has actually been [declining](./assets/life-expectancy-chart.png) since 2014.

# Why haven't we seen a reduction in disease burden?

So, this explosion in technology, data, and spending has produced no measurable improvement
in human health.  The reason, in a single word, is **incentives**. The current economic system punishes every stakeholder in the ecosystem for doing the things that would lead to progress.

## $157 Billion Wasted on Duplication of Effort

There are more than [350,000](https://www.emarketer.com/content/over-350k-digital-health-apps-flooding-market-here-s-how-apps-stand) health apps. Mobile health app development costs [$425,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) on average.  Most of these
have a ton of overlap in functionality representing [$157,500,000,000](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/mobile-health-app-development-costs-425000-average-likely-continuing-rise) wasted on duplication of effort.

If this code was freely shared, everyone could build on what everyone else had done could increase the rate of
progress by 350,000 times.

![closed source competition vs open source collaboration](./assets/closed-source-competition-vs-open-source-collaboration.sketch.png)

The obstacle has been the free-rider problem. Software Developers that open source their code give their
closed-source competitors an unfair advantage.  This increases their likelihood of bankruptcy even higher than the 90% failure rate they already faced.

### How to Overcome the Free-Rider Problem

1. Currently governments around the world are spending billions funding closed-source propriety health software. The
   Public Money Public Code initiative would require governments to recognize software as a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) and require that publicly-funded software be open source.
2. By encoding contributions to the project with NFTs, we have the ability to guarantee ongoing compensation in the
   form of royalties.

## Isolated Data Silos

The best that isolated data on individual aspects of human health can do is tell us about the past. For example,
dashboards telling us how many steps we got or how much sleep we got are known as ‚Äúdescriptive statistics‚Äù.  However,
by integrating all available data from individuals, similar populations, as well as existing clinical research
findings and applying machine learning we may achieve ‚Äúprescriptive‚Äù real-time decision support.

To facilitate data sharing, the DAO will provide data providers with an onsite easily provisionable OAuth2 API server that will allow individuals to anonymously share their data with the global biobank.

## Lack of Incentive to Research Unpatentable Molecules

We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over [7,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8757191/Are-additives-food-making-ill.html) different synthetic or natural chemicals you consume every day.

Under the current system of research, it costs [$41k](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/getting-a-handle-on-clinical-trial-costs-0001#:~:text=The%20clinical%20trials%20cost%20a,and%20benchmarking%20clinical%20trial%20costs.) per subject in Phase III clinical trials. As a result, there is not a sufficient profit incentive for anyone to research the effects of any factor besides a molecule that can be patented.

Lack of Incentive to Discover the Full Range of Applications for Off-Patent Treatments

There are roughly [10,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/17/are-there-really-10000-diseases-and-500-cures/) known diseases afflicting humans, most of which (approximately 95%) are classified as ‚Äúorphan‚Äù (rare) diseases. The current system requires that a pharmaceutical company predict a particular condition in advance of running clinical trials. If a drug is found to be effective for other diseases after the patent has expired, no one has the financial incentive to get it approved for another disease.

Observational real-world evidence-based studies have several advantages over randomized, controlled trials, including
lower cost, greater timeliness, and a broader range of patients. Concern about inherent bias in these studies,
however, has limited their use in comparing treatments. Observational studies have been primarily used in
situations in which randomized, controlled trials would be impossible or unethical. However,
meta-analyses found that when applying modern
statistical methodologies to observational studies, the results are generally not quantitatively or qualitatively
different from those obtained in randomized, controlled trials.

Thus by treating the human as a black box and applying predictive
machine learning models to all of the existing real-world data to stratified groups of similar people based on their:

- Genomic
- Metabolomic
- Microbiomic
- Diseasomic
- Pharmacomic

will enable us to discover the full range of positive and negative for all factors without a profit incentive
for traditional trials.

# Platform

The platform will consist of two primary components:

1. Core Framework - This will be open-source and include only features that are universally necessary.  This
   primarily consists of user authentication, data owner access controls, data storage, data validation, and an API
   for storage and retrieval.
   The DAO will compensate contributors to the core platform.
2. Plugins - These will be modules that provide additional functionality data import from specific sources, data mapping to various formats, data analysis, data visualization, notifications. These may be free or monetized by their creator.

## Technical Framework

### 1. Data Ingestion API (core component)

Challenge: To acquire, extract, transform, and normalize the countless unstandardized data export file formats and data structures and load them into a standardized structure that can be easily analyzed in order to derive clinical insight.

Approach: We will develop an application programming interface (API) and OpenAPI specification for receiving and sharing data with the core database.  Software development kits (SDK‚Äôs) will be made available for 3rd party applications to use to interact with the API. Plugins will enable spreadsheet upload/import and scheduled imports from existing third-party
API‚Äôs.

Impact: The API connector framework will allow the ongoing regular import of user data after a single user authorization.  SDK‚Äôs will enable developers to implement easy automatic sharing options in their applications. An increase in the quantity of data will produce a proportional increase in the number of clinical discoveries made.

### 2. Raw Data Storage (core component)

Data will be encrypted stored in its raw format in flat files on a secure cloud provider defined in the
framework instance platform settings.  Preservation of the data in its original format will allow for:

1. Asynchronous Queued Data Parsing Jobs - This is necessary to allow for the data to be parsed in parallel
   offline and avoid overloading the web server.
2. Storage of data incompatible with a time-series relational data store.
3. Storage of data formats that do not yet have defined parser plugins.  This will allow for the data to imported
   at a later date when the data mapper has been defined.
4. Updating parsers to support changes in the response format for a particular API.

### 3. Data Mappers (core components and plugins)

These will be executed in an asynchronous queue to map the raw data to a standardized format and provide it to the
validator.  The most common data mappers will be defined in the framework.  Less common data mappers will be
available as plugins from 3rd party developers.

### 4. Data Validation (core component)

The data validation validation middleware will validate the data before it is stored in the relational database.  It
will be responsible for ensuring that the data is in a consistent format and that it is not malformed. It
will also ensure that values are within the expected range for a given variable or unit.

#### 5. Relational Time Series Data Storage (core component)

After validation and mapping, time-series data will be stored in a relational database.  Use of a
relational data store with defined foreign key relationships will ensure atomicity and data veracity.

### 6. Data Owner Dashboard (core component)

A data owner dashboard will allow them to manage their data and access control settings. It will allow them to:

- view their data and the OAuth clients with access to it
- modify read/write permissions for specific OAuth clients
- restrict access to their data to specific users and groups
- delete data
- view their current compensation balance and make withdrawals
- update their profile information
- configure 2-factor authentication

## Plugin Types

### 1. Data Analysis

Challenge: To quantify the effectiveness of treatments for specific individuals, reveal hidden factors exacerbating their illness, and determine personalized optimal daily values for these factors.

Approach: We will develop time-series data mining algorithms to quantify correlations between every combination of variables for a given subject. We will also design algorithms capable of determining the minimum quantities of nutrient intake, sleep, exercise, medications, and other factors necessary to minimize symptom severity.

Impact: This will mitigate the incidence of chronic illnesses by informing the user of symptom triggers, such as dietary sensitivities, to be avoided. This will also assist patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive experiment.

### 2. Data Visualization

Challenge: To visualize the data from a given subject or group in a meaningful way.

### 3. API Connectors

TODO

## Requirements

* Individuals should be able to anonymously share data such as health records, insurance records, diet data, pharmacy records, and food purchase data with the biobank and receive compensation for use of their data.
* All biobanks should have well-documented APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that nonprofits, businesses, and academics can use to allow users to share their data.
